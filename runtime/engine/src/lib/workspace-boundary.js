// THE WORKSPACE BOUNDARY, ENFORCED AT RUN TIME.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. At Standard, Fleet promises the assistant "cannot
// reach off the workspace through a tool", and setup records the chosen folder
// in machine.json as `workspaceRoots`. A recorded root that no dispatch path
// reads is not a boundary: a permission profile NAME such as
// "confined/workspace" bounds nothing by itself, and a path argument such as
// search.index's `root` could otherwise reach a secrets directory outside the
// recorded root and read and index it.
//
// This module is the one place that answers "is this path inside what the user
// actually granted?".
//
// IT ANSWERS ABOUT PATHS ONLY. It does not decide which tools are confined
// (src/lib/confined-tool-surface.js) nor which tiers exist
// (src/lib/permission-tier-policy.js). One question per module, so a change to
// the containment rule cannot quietly become a change to the tool surface.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WINDOWS IS THE HARD CASE, AND EVERY ITEM BELOW IS A BYPASS THIS CODEBASE HAS
// EITHER SEEN OR WOULD HAVE SHIPPED.
//
//   `..` segments        C:\ws\..\..\Users -- defeated by path.resolve, which
//                        normalises before anything else looks at the string.
//   case                 C:\WS vs C:\ws are the SAME directory on Windows and
//                        different strings in JavaScript. A case bypass was
//                        closed in this codebase last night for the same
//                        reason in a different file (`{...process.env}` keys
//                        are case-sensitive while Windows env vars are not),
//                        so this compares case-insensitively on win32 only --
//                        POSIX paths really are case-sensitive and folding
//                        there would WIDEN the boundary.
//   8.3 short names      <profile>\DOCUME~1 resolves to <profile>\Documents. String
//                        comparison never sees it. fs.realpathSync.native
//                        expands short names to their long form; the
//                        JavaScript realpathSync does NOT reliably do so.
//                        This is why .native is used and its absence is fatal
//                        rather than a fallback to the weaker function.
//   symlinks / junctions A junction inside the workspace pointing at C:\ is
//                        contained by string and not by reach. Both the root
//                        and the candidate are resolved to their real
//                        locations before they are compared.
//   UNC + device paths   \\server\share and \\?\C:\ and \\.\PhysicalDrive0
//                        bypass normalisation rules entirely; \\?\ in
//                        particular tells Win32 to skip path parsing, so
//                        \\?\C:\ws\..\..\ is NOT normalised by the OS. They
//                        are refused outright rather than reasoned about.
//   alternate streams    C:\ws\file.txt:evil is a different stream on the same
//                        volume; a colon after the drive-letter position is
//                        refused.
//   prefix collision     C:\workspace-evil starts with C:\workspace. Comparison
//                        is per path SEGMENT, never by string prefix.
//   non-existent target  A write target does not exist yet, so realpath throws
//                        on it. Resolving only the nearest EXISTING ancestor
//                        and re-appending the rest is what makes a write fence
//                        possible at all -- and the ancestor walk is why a
//                        symlinked parent of a not-yet-created file is still
//                        caught.
//
// FAIL CLOSED EVERYWHERE. Unreadable roots, no roots, a malformed candidate, a
// realpath that throws for any reason other than "does not exist" -- all refuse.
// A boundary that answers "allowed" when it does not know is not a boundary.
