 * owner.journal every local message is appended to; agent-comms-control keeps
 * channel membership and owner-special designation; mcp.tool-surface keeps the
 * instance records system.status reports. Reaching them through this tool let an
 * agent forge a message from another agent, read the owner's retained traffic,
 * poison the roster, or corrupt the surface record.
 *
 * `contentTrust: untrusted` on a result is an INTEGRITY label -- it says the
 * bytes grant no authority. It is not confidentiality, and it does nothing at
 * all on a write.
 *
 * THE CHECK BELONGS HERE, NOT IN StateStore. The trusted internal writers
 * (agent-comms/history.js, agent-comms/control-plane.js, mcp-tool-surface.js)
 * call the very same setMemory/getMemory, so refusing inside the store would
 * break the product's own state. This module is the public tool boundary and
 * the only caller that must be bounded.
 *
 * agent-coord is deliberately NOT here: it is the inter-agent coordination
 * board agents are told to use, and this tool's own description documents it. */

   * timer is deliberately left REFERENCED ("queued records with waiting callers
   * are work the process owes, not a background nicety"), so a pending record
