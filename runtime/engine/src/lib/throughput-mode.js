/**
 * The `tools.throughput` setting: how the capability layer trades per-call
 * ceremony for speed when many agents call tools at once.
 *
 *   fast    (default)  Tool calls from one connection are scheduled by their
 *                      effect -- reads run side by side, writes keep their
 *                      order per agent -- and every call's audit record joins a
 *                      group commit (src/lib/audit-admission.js) instead of
 *                      taking the ledger's writer lock on its own. The record
 *                      is still durable before the call answers.
 *   strict             The previous behaviour: one call at a time per
 *                      connection and one writer-lock acquisition per record.
 *
 * Product requirement: this must keep things secure and tracked
 * without slowing down a user, even one with 1000 agents making tool calls.
 * The default is therefore `fast`; a
 * person who wants the older one-at-a-time behaviour chooses it.
 *
 * Read on the hot path of every tool call, so the answer is memoised for a
 * few seconds. An unreadable settings file yields the default rather than a
 * refusal: throughput is not a security boundary, and the audit ledger's own
 * fail-closed rules are unchanged in either mode.
