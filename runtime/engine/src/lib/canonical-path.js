// A path-containment check that only inspects the lexical,
// string-resolved path is defeated by any reparse point (a Windows
// junction/symlink) anywhere in its ancestor chain, because the OS follows
// the reparse point when the file is actually opened but a string regex
// never sees it. Verified live on a real Windows profile, where the profile
// root is written here as %USERPROFILE% because the specific account it was
// observed on is irrelevant to the defect -- every Windows profile has these:
//   %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings       -> %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local
//   %USERPROFILE%\Application Data     -> %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming
//   %USERPROFILE%\My Documents         -> %USERPROFILE%\Documents
// These are legacy Windows-profile compatibility junctions present by
// default, not something exotic an attacker has to plant -- a caller can
// spell an excluded target (e.g. AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials)
// through its legacy alias (Local Settings\Microsoft\Credentials) and a
// string-pattern exclusion list never matches, even though both spellings
// open the identical file.
//
// The host file provider's fix: after the existing lexical checks pass,
// ALSO canonicalize the target with fs.realpathSync.native (which resolves
// every junction/symlink in the chain) and re-run the exact same
// containment/exclusion checks against the canonical form. A lexical pass
// alone is necessary but not sufficient; the canonical pass is what closes
// the bypass. The canonical form is used ONLY for the safety check -- the
// original lexical path is still what the caller's read/write/list actually
// operates on, so the OS's own reparse-point handling stays the single
// source of truth for what a path "really" opens.
