// THE FIRST WRITER OF DECLARED ORG STATE.
//
// Until this file existed the declared organisation was read-only end to end.
// config/agent-org.json was authored by hand in the builder's own checkout,
// tools/gen-fleet.mjs read it at BUILD time and emitted a static projection,
// and the application read that projection over its loopback server. Every
// consumer in src/lib was a reader. So the drag-to-reparent control on the
// agent page wrote `agent.parentId` on an object that the next projection load
// rebuilt from JSON, and the edit vanished with no error -- the control looked
// like it worked and could not have worked.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN WHAT IT DOES.
//
// It does not implement a second organisation model. Every mutation here is
// applied to a plain object and handed to agentOrg.normalizeOrg(), which is
// what decides whether the result is legal. That is deliberate: agent-org.js
// already refuses a management cycle, an agent with two managers, a relationship
// naming an agent that does not exist, and an org without exactly one
// controller. Re-deriving any of those here would be a fourth copy of a rule
// that already has three (the graph's hover guard, the projection's commit
// guard, and the normalizer), and the copy would be the one that drifts.
//
// A REPARENT IS A RELATIONSHIP EDIT, NOT A FIELD EDIT. The page's model gives
// each agent a `parentId`, which is a convenient shape for drawing a tree. The
// declared org has never had that field. It expresses hierarchy as
// `{ from, to, type: 'manages' }` edges, because an org needs to say more than
// parentage -- it also carries `reviews`, `delegates_to` and `escalates_to`,
// and an agent can have several of those while having exactly one manager. So
// reparenting removes the incoming `manages` edge and adds one from the new
// parent, and leaves every other edge alone.
//
// WHERE THE EDIT LIVES. Not in config/agent-org.json. In a packaged install
// that file is inside the payload, it is replaced wholesale at pack time by
// capability-defaults/config/agent-org.json, and it is loaded through
// require(), which caches -- so writing it would be edited-in-place data that
// the packaging guard is trying to keep clean, discarded on the next update,
// and not visible to the running process anyway. The overlay lives in
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\ToolsEnabled, next to machine.json and the settings file.
//
// THE BASELINE IS STILL READ. An installation that has never been edited has no
// overlay, and reads the shipped default. The first edit seeds the overlay from
// whatever the baseline said at that moment, and records the baseline's
// contentHash alongside it. That recorded hash is not decoration: it is how a
// later version can TELL that the shipped default has moved on underneath an
// operator's edits, and say so, rather than silently keeping stale seats or
// silently discarding the operator's work.

     * Rewriting `provider` would revoke every live Controller on the old

     * `providers` and `provider` stays as it was, unless it was still "none".

     * always had, since a tree node's seat carries only that node's own
