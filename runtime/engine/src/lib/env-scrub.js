// REMOVING AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE ON WINDOWS, WHERE `delete` IS NOT ENOUGH.
//
// Windows environment variables are case-INSENSITIVE. `process.env` honours
// that. But `{ ...process.env }` produces a PLAIN object, and plain-object
// property access is case-SENSITIVE. So the shape this codebase uses
// everywhere:
//
//     const env = { ...process.env };
//     delete env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL;
//
// removes only that exact spelling. A variable set as `anthropic_base_url`
// survives -- and the child process, whose OS lookup is case-insensitive,
// reads it anyway.
//
// On win32, spawning a real child with the scrubbed environment:
//
//     set as ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL   -> survives delete: false  child sees it: false
//     set as anthropic_base_url   -> survives delete: true   child sees it: TRUE
//     set as Anthropic_Base_Url   -> survives delete: true   child sees it: TRUE
//
// This is not a hypothetical casing. `setx anthropic_api_key ...` is an
// ordinary thing for a user or an installer to do on Windows, because Windows
// does not care -- so nothing looks wrong at any point. The failure is silent
// in both directions: the guard reports success, and the child works.
//
// The consequence is the credential-leak failure that the credential scrubs exist to
// prevent -- an ambient API key reaching a child that bills it instead of the
// user's subscription, "for hours while reporting logged in" -- recurring with
// every guard in place and passing.
//
// WHY A MODULE AND NOT A FIX AT EACH CALL SITE. A mitigation applied where
// you are looking is one the next caller forgets. The NAME LISTS stay where
// they are -- they are genuinely different questions -- but the removal
// mechanism is one function.
//
// Two defects that an Object.keys() implementation cannot see are handled
// here:
//
//  1. INHERITED ENUMERABLE KEYS. Node builds a child's environment with
//     `for (const key in options.env)` -- its own source comments that
//     "prototype values are intentionally included". `for...in` walks the
//     prototype chain; `Object.keys()` does not. So an enumerable
//     `anthropic_api_key` on Object.prototype would be invisible to an
//     Object.keys() remover AND detector, while a real child reads it
//     canonically.
//
//  2. DETECTION MUST NOT FAIL OPEN ON `null`. `spawn(cmd, args, { env: null })`
//     makes node INHERIT THE FULL AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT, so `null` never means
//     "not present". The one input that leaks the most must not get the most
//     reassuring answer.

/* Node's own child-environment enumeration, which this must agree with exactly.
 * Collected into an array BEFORE any mutation, because deleting during a
 * `for...in` is not safe to reason about. */

  const names = [];

/* THE CASE FOLD, AND THE OVER-REMOVAL IT DELIBERATELY ACCEPTS.
 *
 * JavaScript's toLowerCase() is a UNICODE fold; Windows' environment-name
 * comparison is not the same function. One divergence: U+212A KELVIN SIGN
 * folds to ASCII `k` in JavaScript, so `ANTHROPIC_API_<KELVIN>EY` compares
 * equal to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` here -- while Windows treats them as two
 * different variables, and a child given the Kelvin spelling sees the CANONICAL
 * name ABSENT and the Kelvin name PRESENT. This function removes it anyway.
 *
 * THE DECISION, MADE DELIBERATELY: keep the Unicode fold and accept the
 * over-removal. Not because it is harmless -- it deletes a variable the OS
 * would have kept -- but because the two errors are not symmetric:
 *
 *   over-removal   a subscription launch loses a variable nothing in this
 *                  product sets, and the caller can re-set it explicitly.
 *   under-removal  the user's API key reaches a child and bills them, silently,
 *                  while every guard reports success. This is the failure
 *                  the scrub must prevent.
 *
 * An ASCII-only fold would match Windows more closely for these lookalikes, and
 * was rejected: Windows' real comparison is a locale-invariant UPPERCASE map
 * that folds some non-ASCII pairs too, so an ASCII-only fold would UNDER-remove
 * for those -- trading a safe error for an unsafe one to fix a name
 * (`ANTHROPIC_API_<KELVIN>EY`) that nothing legitimate sets. The cost is
 * bounded and re-settable; the benefit is that no lookalike spelling of a
 * credential can survive. tests/providers/credential-scrub-round2.test.js pins
 * this against a real child ("the Unicode fold DELIBERATELY over-removes...")
 * so it stays a decision rather than drifting back into an accident. */

 * hiding. So after deleting, re-check reachability and TOMBSTONE what remains:
 * an own, ENUMERABLE property whose value is `undefined`.
 *
 * WHY ENUMERABLE, WHICH LOOKS BACKWARDS. A non-enumerable shadow removes the
 * key from this object correctly and is then SILENTLY LOST by the next
 * `{ ...env }` -- spread copies own ENUMERABLE properties only -- at which point
 * the fresh object inherits the polluted prototype again and the leak is back.
 * A launch environment built by spreading one environment into the next would
 * undo a non-enumerable shadow on every step: with a real child, a
 * non-enumerable shadow leaves ANTHROPIC_API_KEY PRESENT; a tombstone, ABSENT.
 *
 * An enumerable `undefined` survives every spread (the copy is itself an own
 * property that shadows the prototype) and node drops it when building the
 * child: its env builder skips keys whose value is `undefined`. So the
 * tombstone is what both of node's own rules already ignore. */
