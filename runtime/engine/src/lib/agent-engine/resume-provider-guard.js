/* A CONVERSATION BELONGS TO THE PROGRAM THAT MINTED IT.
 *
 * Thread ids from both providers are UUID-shaped and `validateThreadId` is a
 * string-length check, so no syntactic test could ever tell a Codex-minted id
 * from a Claude-minted one. A Claude id handed to the Codex adapter would
 * spawn the wrong CLI, which exits with "No conversation found with session
 * ID", and the failure return would have the same shape as a success.
 *
 * This module owns the one rule, so the two adapters cannot drift apart on it,
 * and so the app can put the same sentence in front of a person. It deliberately
 * does NOT throw: each process module raises its own error type
 * (ClaudeCliError / CodexAdapterError) so a caller's existing `instanceof` and
 * code handling keep working. This returns the refusal, or null to proceed.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT MISMATCHED, and that distinction is the whole compatibility
 * story. Every thread minted before 1.0.42 has no recorded provider, and every
 * existing resume test in the engine and the app resumes exactly such a thread.
 * "Unknown is refused" and "existing suites stay green unmodified" cannot both
 * be true, so the rule is:
 *
 *   absent            -> permitted (a pre-1.0.42 thread), and protected instead
 *                        by the failure now being failure-shaped
 *   same provider     -> permitted
 *   a different KNOWN provider -> refused, naming both
 *   anything else     -> refused as unidentifiable, never assumed to match
