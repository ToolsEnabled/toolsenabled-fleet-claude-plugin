 *   b. NO DIRECTORY MEANS THE DEFAULT PATH. With no `configDir` the

 *      normal flow. Fleet's subagents name no directory.
 *   c. The official program handles authentication for its selected directory.

 * and during one evening this process died repeatedly

 *   - It does not create the directory. A directory nobody has signed into is

 *     who owns the account. Making it here would manufacture a home that looks
 *     provisioned and is not.
 *

 * child's working directory -- the person's project folder -- and quietly create
 * a per-project sign-in nobody asked for. This is the same refusal
 * src/lib/runtime-state-root.js makes, for the same reason, in its own words:
