 * that launcher from a process with no console (which is what the packaged app
 * is, and what windowsHide correctly makes this child) and Windows gives the
 * native codex.exe a NEW console WITH A WINDOW, even when this child was
 * spawned with windowsHide: true. A flag cannot reach a grandchild.

 * ../proc/hidden-spawn.js, and that is what runs. The launcher contributes

/* WHY THE FALLBACK IS A SEARCH, AND WHY `codex.cmd` WAS NEVER THE ANSWER.
 *
 * This branch used to return the bare string `codex.cmd`, reasoning that PATH
 * resolution belongs to the spawn and that cmd.exe cannot execute a file
 * without an extension it recognises. Both halves of that are true. The
 * conclusion does not follow: `.cmd` is the shim NPM writes, and npm is exactly
 * the install the line above has already ruled out. Every other way Codex
 * reaches a Windows machine -- the winget package (OpenAI.Codex), a scoop shim,
 * a hand-placed portable copy -- lays down codex.exe and NO codex.cmd at all.
 * So the branch reached only by "not installed through npm" resolved a filename
 * that only an npm install ever creates, and could not find anything else:
 * cmd.exe answers 9009 for a missing `codex.cmd`, detectCodexVersion() reads
 * 9009 as missing, and a person with a working winget install would be told to
 * install Codex.
 *
 * PATHEXT ORDER IS CMD.EXE'S OWN ORDER, directory-major, which puts .EXE ahead
 * of .CMD. A native executable therefore wins over a shim in the same
 * directory, and spawnHidden runs it directly with no cmd.exe wrapper -- the
 * quieter path, and the one hidden-spawn's own launcher rule already prefers.
 *
 * IT ANSWERS FROM THE PATH IT IS GIVEN, deliberately, and does not go looking
 * for a second copy. On Windows a process can be holding a login-time PATH that
 * predates an install, but reconciling that against the registry is the HOST's
 * job and the host already does it: shell/agent-host.cjs composes the machine
 * search path and hands it down as this env. Reading the registry here as well
 * would put the same decision in two places and, worse, would defeat a caller
 * that pinned PATH on purpose -- which is how this module's own tests keep a
 * fixture from finding whatever Codex the test machine happens to have. */

/* WHY THIS FUNCTION TOUCHES THE ENVIRONMENT AT ALL.
 *
 * resolveInvocation() runs codex.js through `process.execPath` rather than a
 * .cmd shim, which is correct and avoids a shell. But `process.execPath` is
 * only `node` when the host IS node. When the host is an Electron binary,
 * Electron does not execute a script argument as Node unless
 * ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE is set. Without it the spawn starts the host binary,
 * which does nothing with the argument and EXITS 0 WITH NO OUTPUT.
 *
 * detectCodexVersion() requires `code === 0 && output`, so an empty stdout on a
 * zero exit falls through to its failure branch and reports the self-
 * contradictory `Unable to run codex --version: exit code 0`. Here the flag is
 * REQUIRED.
 *
 * Only set when we are actually re-entering our own binary as a script host.
 * A plain `codex`/`codex.cmd` spawn must NOT inherit it: that would push the
 * flag into an unrelated child and cause the more familiar failure mode.

/* THE SAME SPAWN, CONTINUING A CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF OPENING ONE.
 *
 * Codex stores a thread on disk and `thread/resume` loads it back by id --
 * the whole history, the cwd it ran in, the model and the effort it had.
 * That is what "the agent restarts" means to a person: the same agent, its
 * own memory, not a summary handed to a stranger.
 *
 * This exists as its own function rather than a flag on the start above for
 * one concrete reason: startCodexSession ALWAYS calls startThread, so
 * resuming through it would materialise a throwaway thread on disk first --
 * a second rollout file, a second entry in every thread list, for a
 * conversation the person only ever had once.
 *
 * The returned shape is startCodexSession's, plus what the resume told us:
 * `turns` (the conversation, newest-bounded by the adapter), `reasoningEffort`
 * and `model` as the ENGINE reports them rather than as we requested them,
 * and the cwd the thread actually holds -- which the caller must check
 * against the folder it means to run in before trusting the session.
