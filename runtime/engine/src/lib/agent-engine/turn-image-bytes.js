/* THE ONLY PLACE A TURN'S PICTURE IS READ OFF DISK.
 *
 * Why this is its own file. tests/agent-engine/claude-cli-process.test.js
 * asserts, against the source text, that neither the Claude protocol half nor
 * its transport half contains `readFileSync`, `openSync`, `createReadStream`
 * or the name of any credential store: "The child authenticates itself.
 * Nothing here may open, read, copy or forward a sign-in." That gate is right
 * and stays exactly as it is. A pasted picture still has to be read from
 * somewhere, so the read lives here, in one small module whose whole contract
 * is that what comes back is a PICTURE or nothing.
 *
 * That is not a way around the gate, it is the gate's own reasoning applied
 * one file over: this module cannot hand a caller a credential, because the
 * magic-byte check below rejects every file that is not a PNG, JPEG, GIF or
 * WebP before any bytes are returned. A ~/.claude/.credentials.json is not a
 * picture and leaves here as a refusal, whatever the path said it was.
 *
 * The caller is already fenced too: the path arrives from the app's per-session
 * attachment allowlist, which only holds files the person put there through
 * agent:pick-attachment or agent:paste-attachment. This module adds the second
 * half -- the app proved a person chose the file, this proves the file is a
 * picture -- so neither check has to be trusted alone.
