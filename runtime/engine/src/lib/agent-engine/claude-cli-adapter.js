/* THE claude CLI, BEHIND THE SAME ADAPTER SEAM AS OTHER PROVIDERS.
 *
 * This adapter maps the CLI protocol and builds its launch arguments. The
 * launch transport owns the environment and sign-in boundary.
 *
 * The mappings below follow the stream claude 2.1.186 emits. It is
 * newline-delimited JSON with these shapes:
 *
 *   system/init                                   -> the session id, then turn_accepted
 *   stream_event/content_block_delta text_delta   -> assistant_text_delta
 *   assistant   content[].type === 'text'         -> assistant_text
 *   assistant   content[].type === 'tool_use'     -> tool_call
 *   assistant   content[].type === 'thinking'     -> thinking
 *   user        content[].type === 'tool_result'  -> tool_result
 *   result                                        -> usage, then turn_completed
 *
 * THINKING REACHES THE HOST AS ITS OWN TYPE, NEVER AS ASSISTANT SPEECH. A
 * thinking block arrives with a `signature` field and is not addressed to the
 * reader, so forwarding it as assistant_text would put the model's private
 * working into the transcript as though the agent had said it. The contract
 * has its own `thinking` type for it, so the user can still see that the
 * model is thinking.
 *
 * TURN_ACCEPTED EXISTS BECAUSE THIS CLI OFFERS NO EARLIER SIGNAL. sendTurn()'s
 * own promise settles at the turn's COMPLETION on this engine (see its header
 * below) -- unlike codex, which acknowledges a turn immediately -- so a caller
 * with no other signal has nothing to watch for "the turn began" until the
 * model is already finished answering. `system/init` is the earliest true
 * receipt this CLI ever sends (see claudeArgs() below: it does not arrive
 * until a user message is sent), so it is forwarded as turn_accepted the
 * moment it is seen. This is additive only: sendTurn()'s promise is untouched,
 * and everything that promise already guarantees (see its own header) still
 * holds exactly as before.
