// file reader (src/lib/search.js#indexPath).
//
// Without it, `path.resolve(rootPath(), value)` followed by
// `fs.statSync(resolved)` has no containment check and no audit call, so an
// absolute `file` argument, or search.js#indexPath's `root` argument, would
// read any file the process could open.
//
// This mirrors host.read_file's containment policy
// (src/lib/providers/host-control.js#resolveHostPath: resolve, then check
// containment, then canonicalize with fs.realpathSync and check the
// canonical form too, so a reparse point or 8.3 short name in the ancestor
// chain cannot walk the check around the fence) but with a NARROWER allowed
// zone than host.read_file's profile breadth: the ToolsEnabled root
// itself, plus whatever folders setup recorded as `workspaceRoots` in
// machine.json (src/lib/setup/machine-record.js), reached through
// src/lib/tool-registry.js#confinedWorkspaceRoots -- the exact list
// agent.spawn's `workspaceRoot` parameter reads ("defaults to the first
// verified workspace root in the machine record"), and a real, already-used
// consumer of machine-record.js's `workspaceRoots` (src/lib/tool-registry.js
// lines ~268, ~409, ~3720). src/lib/settings.js also republishes the same
// field under CAPABILITY_WORKSPACE_ROOTS_ID (capabilityBoundaryReadback), but
// a grep of src/ for that id and that function name turns up NO caller other
// than settings.js's own loadSettings() -- the settings.read UI backend, not
// a dispatch-path reader -- so it is not, in fact, "the way the rest of the
// engine" reads these roots for an enforcement decision; confinedWorkspaceRoots
// is. Both ultimately read the identical `workspaceRoots` field out of the
// same machine-record.js, so this is a choice of wrapper, not of data source.
// Either way, this is reuse of an existing reader, not a second hand-rolled
// parse of machine-record.js.
// Both language-server code intelligence and the embedding index run
// untrusted-derived tooling (a spawned language server; an embedder) against
// file content, and are meant to inspect the user's own recorded project(s)
// -- not anything the process account happens to be able to read.

//     AuditRequiredError (code AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE, or AUDIT_DISABLED if audit
//     is turned off), not a CodeIntelError, propagated raw -- every code.*
//     call stops cold until the ledger is repaired. host.read_file accepts

//     the dispatch-layer's own tool-name-only mcp.tool.* record), but
//     nothing here waits for durability or anchoring, and nothing here
//     throws if the ledger is unavailable: the read succeeds regardless.
//   'none': no provider-level read audit call at all. The dispatch-layer
//     mcp.tool.succeeded/mcp.tool.failed record (src/lib/tool-registry.js
//     #auditInvocation) still lands either way, for every mode, since it is
