// THE SCORER. PURE: (artifact, query, options) -> ranked candidates.
//
// No I/O, no clock, no globals. Everything it needs arrives as arguments, so
// the tuner can run it ten thousand times over a gold set in a second and the
// tests can score against a hand-built artifact.
//
// BM25F over four fields (identity / title / body / alias) rather than four
// separate BM25 runs added together. The difference matters: BM25's saturation
// term must be applied ONCE to a term's total evidence, otherwise a word that
// appears in three fields is counted as three independent pieces of evidence
// instead of one strong one, and long descriptions beat exact id matches.
//
// TWO PRECISION RULES, LIFTED FROM tools/retrieval/fts-index.js, for the
// reasons recorded there:
//
//   * a 3+ word question must be matched on at least two of its words;
//   * a matched word counts only if it is rare enough to discriminate, OR the
//     tool names it in its own identity or alias.
//
// The second half is not decoration. With only the rarity rule, a word that
// is common across the catalogue would never count, even for the one tool
// that names it.
//
// AND ONE THE OTHER SURFACES DID NOT HAVE: THE FLOOR IS ABSOLUTE AND THE SCORE
// IS NORMALISED.
//
// tools/grepsaver-orient.js uses a floor RELATIVE to the best hit, and its own
// comments record what that costs: "when the best hit is itself noise every
// near-noise hit clears it... 'gmail thread read' returned three unrelated
// project cards". A relative floor cannot express "none
// of these is good enough", which is the answer most prompts deserve.
//
// So each candidate's raw BM25F is divided by the most any document could
// possibly have scored on this query (the sum of the query terms' IDF, which
// is BM25's limit as term frequency goes to infinity). The result is a
// coverage fraction in [0, 1): "how much of the available evidence did this
// document actually account for". A fixed threshold on THAT is stable across
// query lengths, which a fixed threshold on raw BM25 is not -- raw scores grow
// with the number of query terms, so one constant would gate a three-word
// prompt and wave through a thirty-word one.

   * block spoke over a greeting. An absent word is not missing evidence; it is
   * evidence that the question is about something else, and it is the MOST
   * informative kind, so it enters at the idf a df of zero earns.
   *
   * (2) A PRIOR MASS, SO SHORT QUERIES CANNOT REACH CERTAINTY CHEAPLY. Without
   * it a one-word prompt that matches its one word scores exactly 1.0 no matter
   * how thin that word is: "stop" returned browser.stop at 0.937. The prior is
   * a constant in the denominator -- the evidence a query would need to carry
   * before a full match means anything -- so coverage becomes "how much of the
