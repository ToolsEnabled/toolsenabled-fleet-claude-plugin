// THE GRAMMAR CARRIES THE ACTION, AND THE TOKENIZER THROWS THE GRAMMAR AWAY.
//
// In "what is on my calendar today" the tokens carry NO action at all. Every
// word carrying the request -- what, is, on, my -- is a stopword, and the only
// survivor is the object. English puts the action of a QUESTION in exactly the
// function words a bag-of-words index must discard, so the action axis fired
// on explicit imperatives ("delete that file") and stayed silent on the
// question forms people actually type.
//
// So action detection reads the RAW text, before tokenisation, and these
// patterns supply what the grammar means. It is the cheapest signal in the
// system: no authoring per tool, no vocabulary to maintain, and it applies to
// all 272 tools at once.
//
// KEPT DELIBERATELY SMALL. This is not a parser and must not grow into one. A
// pattern belongs here only when it names an ACTION that the words alone
// cannot -- "what/which/how many" means read, "let me know" means send. A
// pattern that merely correlates with a topic belongs in the object
// vocabulary, where IDF can judge it.
