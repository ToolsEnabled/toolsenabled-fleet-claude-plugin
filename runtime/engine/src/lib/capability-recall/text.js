// ONE TOKENIZER, USED BY THE BUILD AND BY EVERY QUERY.
//
// This file exists as its own module for a single reason: a query term the
// index could never contain produces a confident MISS for a document that is
// sitting right there. tools/retrieval/fts-index.js states the same rule about
// matching SQLite's unicode61 tokenizer, and this is the same hazard one step
// further -- if the builder and the scorer disagree by one suffix rule, the
// artifact is wrong in a way no test of either half alone can see.
//
// So: the builder imports tokenize() from here, the scorer imports tokenize()
// from here, and the artifact records TOKENIZER_VERSION. An artifact built by a
// different tokenizer version is refused at load rather than answered from.
//
// THE STOPWORD LIST IS DELIBERATELY THE SAME LIST as tools/retrieval/fts-index.js
// and tools/prior-work-index.js. Two discovery surfaces that disagree about
// whether "how" is a searchable word give two different answers to the same
// question, and the disagreement is invisible.
