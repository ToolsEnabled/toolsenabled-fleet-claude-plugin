// HOW MUCH AUDIT HISTORY STAYS IN THE ACTIVE LEDGER, AND WHAT THAT COSTS.
//
// An unbounded audit ledger grows with every tool call: at about 1,500 events
// a day it holds ~35,000 events after three weeks and ~550,000 after a year.
// Every short-lived process verifies the whole ledger before it may read or
// write, so without a bound each start re-proves more of the same immutable
// bytes.
//
// This module decides WHEN an event leaves the live ledger for signed cold
// storage (audit.js's rollArchiveOnce does the moving). Nothing here deletes
// anything; it only answers "is the live window over its limit".
//
// It also computes what each choice costs, because the product rule is
// explicit that the customer must be told, clearly and when they choose their
// settings, what system load each choice brings.

// The verification cost per event. Full verification of a 34,895-event
// ledger takes about 3,900 ms end to end (Ed25519 ~2,970 ms + content binding
// ~839 ms + row read ~125 ms), and the cost is linear in event count.
// Recalibrate from a new timing if the verification path changes.

// Is the live window over its limit? Answers for ONE event -- the oldest --

// each new event placed, never the whole record at once). A bulk
// purge would reintroduce exactly the multi-second
// stall on a customer machine that this work exists to remove; amortising it
// one event at a time keeps the per-append cost flat and invisible.
// HOW FAR OVER AN EVENT WINDOW MAY GROW BEFORE IT ROLLS. One percent of the
// window, at least one event, at most a thousand. The roll then brings the
// live window back to exactly the policy value, so a customer never keeps
// FEWER events than they chose; for a while they keep up to this many more.
// Rolling one event per append at the cap would rewrite both projection files
// (about 18 MB together) inside the writer lock on every append.
// HOW FAR OVER THE WINDOW THE LEDGER MAY DRIFT BEFORE IT ROLLS.
//
// A roll rewrites BOTH projection files for the whole live window (about
// 11.5 MB + 6.7 MB at 10,000 events) and invalidates every process's parse
// memo of them. At the cap with many busy agents and 1% slack (100 events),
// the audit worker rolled every minute or two and then re-read and re-parsed
// ~18 MB per admission -- ~50 MB of allocation a minute and a 313 MB worker
// heap. 5% (500 events at 10,000; never more than 2,000)
// keeps the same promise -- the person never keeps fewer than the policy says,
// briefly a few more -- at a twentieth of the rewrite rate.
