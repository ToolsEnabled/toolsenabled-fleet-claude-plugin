/**
 * GROUP COMMIT FOR THE AUDIT LEDGER.
 *
 * Every tool call writes at least one signed audit event. audit.record()
 * admits one event per acquisition of the ledger's single cross-process
 * writer lock, and the admission's fixed cost -- anchor reads, chain
 * verification, projection file handling -- can reach 70-120 ms of held lock
 * per event. Because one server process dispatches every agent's calls one
 * after another, that cost would be paid serially by the whole fleet.
 *
 * This queue coalesces records that arrive close together into one batch and
 * hands the batch to audit.recordBatch(), which admits all of them under one
 * lock. Callers still await their own record's status: a tool call answers
 * only after the transaction carrying its event has committed, so nothing
 * becomes "durable later". What changes is how many callers share one
 * admission.
 *
 * OFF THE MAIN THREAD. When worker threads are available the batch is
 * admitted on a dedicated worker (audit-admission-worker.js), so the
 * synchronous SQLite and signing work never blocks the event loop that serves
 * tool calls. From the ledger's point of view the worker is one
 * more writer process, which is what every other broker already is; the
 * cross-process witness checks that keep those honest keep this one honest.
 * If the worker cannot start, or dies, the queue admits batches in-thread
 * and keeps going -- slower, never less durable.
 *
 * One batch is in flight at a time. Under load that makes the batch size
 * follow the arrival rate on its own: whatever arrived while the previous
 * batch was committing becomes the next batch.
