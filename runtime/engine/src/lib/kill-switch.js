 * CONTAINED), takes no approval -- approvalEligible defaults to
 * effect === 'external-write' and this verb is 'local-write' -- and writes no
 * required durable intent for the same reason. The optional per-call summary in
 * auditInvocation is off by default (runtime-policy audit.activity defaults to
 * 'Off'), and recorded no agent identity even when on. So an agent that ingests
 * a poisoned page or repo file can refuse every outward operation on the person's
 * machine, and the only evidence left behind is a time.
 *
 * With three agents running, "the brake was pulled and nobody knows by whom" is
 * exactly the state an incident response cannot start from. The marker is the
 * one record that is always written, whatever the audit policy says, so the
 * attribution belongs here as well as in the audit.
 *
 * Every value is caller-supplied, so each is flattened to a single line and
 * bounded before it is written: an agent id carrying a newline must not be able
 * to forge additional fields in this file.
