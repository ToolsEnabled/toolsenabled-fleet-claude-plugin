     * SHARED_WRITE_CONFLICT -- "Another assistant already holds the whole-file
     * write lock" -- with holderPid null.

     * That direction is SAFE: it refuses rather than writing. Two things about
     * it are not, and are left as they are here:
     *   - the sentence is false. Nobody holds the lock; the file is corrupt.
     *     The person is told to wait for an assistant that does not exist.
     *   - it never clears. reclaimLiveHolderAfterMs is Infinity here on purpose,
     *     so a corrupt lock file refuses every shared write to that target
     *     forever, until somebody deletes it by hand.
     * Fixing either means changing what acquireStateLock reports, which is lock
     * behaviour and is deliberately not being changed from here. */
