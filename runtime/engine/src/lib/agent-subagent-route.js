// This module decides one question: when a
// spawn does come through this product's tool, does the new assistant become a
// CIRCLE ON THE PERSON'S TREE -- its own name, its own conversation, the same
// stop button as one they started by hand -- or a LANE off it, bounded and
// recorded but never drawn.
//
// WHY "LET THE ASSISTANT DECIDE" IS THE SHIPPED ANSWER, AND WHAT IT DECIDES BY.
//
// The person is already choosing per request, in the request itself (for
// example, asking for every agent to launch under the visible tree). Someone who has never
// opened this row should get what they asked for in the words they used.
//
// And when the request says nothing, the answer is NOT a coin toss: it is
// whether the ASKING assistant is itself a circle on the tree. A tree circle
// handing work down is building a team the person is already watching, and its
// children belong beside it; an assistant that is not on the tree has no place
// to put a child, and inventing one would draw on a tree nobody pointed at.
// That rule needs no argument from the caller and cannot be got wrong by an
// assistant that never read this file.
//
// The two forcing values exist because a person who wants one answer every time
// should not have to say it every time, and because "Never on your tree" is the
// only way to be certain an assistant cannot add circles to a tree they are
// reading.
//
// This module decides and explains. It starts nothing.
